Spring Jenkins DSL jobs

## About

These Jenkins DSL jobs are used for setting up the folder(s), pipeline(s) and monitor(s) for the Jenkins instance. **medium-jenkins-jcasc** is setting up a seed job that loads all files using the
extension **.groovy** in this repository. There is a cron job loading these files every midnight to check if something is new.
